# Real-Estate-Idle
An Idle Game
An idle game. The main goal of the game is to buy, upgrade and rent buildings, while taking control of the city. Every time you buy, upgrade and rent a building, 
you earn a money increase. You can buy, upgrade buildings if you have enough money. 
There is no price for the rent, but there is a time limit, and when this period expires, for money increase it has to be rented again. 

Offline progress represents the money you will earn per second while you are not in the game. Each time you press the button, you gain an increase in this value. 

For character movement you can use your WASD keyboard buttons or right-left-stop buttons at the top left corner.  

Speed increase button opens a submenu for adjusting the player's speed so that you can move quickly and rent buildings more effectively.
